A re-implementation of the Perl CPAN module HTML::Template in PowerShell, which has bugger all decent templating. Used to separate form from function. You can generate data structures in PowerShell, write a template file with placeholders for the data, and then call this module to generate the output. Ideal for creating HTML output from PowerShell without embedding the HTML into the program, making it easy for others to change the look of the output.

Status: Alpha, but stable and usable
